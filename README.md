 List Pagination and Filtering


With the use of javascript we'll create 2 functions. One whose purpose is to
create pagination links according to how many items (from any given list) we want to show on each page and
another function whose purpose is to display the items that correspond to the pagination
link that was clicked.

I followed all the instructions given and actively didn't make any changes to any of the files except the script.js file.

This project was great practice with Traversing the DOM and also gave me a great opportunity to practice debugging
using Chrome's Dev Tools.

I've attempted to earn the 'Exceeds Expectations' grade by adding a search feature that lets you filter the list to match your searched criteria.
